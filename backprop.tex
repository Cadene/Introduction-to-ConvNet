\begin{itemize}
 \item Backprop principle
 \item General derivation equation (reference to the general scheme notations in \ref{intro})
 \item General update equation
 \item Short explanation about all learning parameters (learning rate, momentum, weight decay...)
 \item Each block can be derived ``independently'' / each block is an ``independent'' part of the backprop chain
 \item[$\rightarrow$] In the following, we describe, for each computational block, its forward formulation $y = f(x)$ and its backward formulation
 \item dropout
\end{itemize}
