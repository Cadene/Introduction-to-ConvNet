\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6071}{Fractional Max-Pooling} suggests a method for performing the pooling operation with filters smaller than 2x2. This is done by randomly generating pooling regions with a combination of 1x1, 1x2, 2x1 or 2x2 filters to tile the input activation map. The grids are generated randomly on each forward pass, and at test time the predictions can be averaged across several grids.
