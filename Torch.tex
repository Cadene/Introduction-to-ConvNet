pros :
\begin{itemize}
 \item easy to shift from CPU to GPU
 \item fast scripting language, LuaJIT
 \item C/CUDA implementation
 \item amazing interface to C, via LuaJIT
 \item maximum flexibility in implementing complex neural network topologies (parallelize nets over CPUs and GPUs)
 \item embeddable, with ports to iOS, Android and FPGA backends
\end{itemize}

cons : 
\begin{itemize}
  \item learning lua 
  \item even with luarocks (package managing) still difficult to deal with libraries (for instance math.round doesn't exist, but math.ceil and math.floor do)
  \item torch.optim, which contain adagrad, rmsprop, sgd, etc., is difficult to use and modify
  \item great ml lib doesn't exist, for instance it's still hard to use a simple SVM
\end{itemize}
