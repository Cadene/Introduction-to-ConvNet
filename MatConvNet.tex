\begin{itemize}
 \item CPU / GPU
 \item Computation times
 \item What is coded for GPU? Where is the big computational improvement of GPU implementation? (A priori convolutions = bottleneck). 
 \item How are convolutions implemented (matricial computation)?
 \item MatLab interface / CUDA + C++
 \item Organization: blocks. To each computational block corresponds a MatLab function. 
 \item If a function does not exist, it can easily be defined by the user. Requirements: forward and backward formulations. Then, it is just another 
block in the backpropagation chain. 
 \item dropout implemented as a layer
 \item 
\end{itemize}
