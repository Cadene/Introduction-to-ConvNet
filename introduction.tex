\label{intro}

\begin{itemize}
 \item General biblio
 \item Can be used as feature extractor or complete system (feature + classif)
 \item In CNN, filters (weights) learned / in traditional Computer Vision, weights handcrafted (predetermined)
 \item CNN general scheme
 \item Each ``step'' can be seen as an ``independent'' block + scheme 
 \item Convolutions $\sim$ representation / fully connected $\sim$ classification
 \item Last layers = N classes
\end{itemize}

In the following, each block is described with $\mathbf{x}$ the block input vector
